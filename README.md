## Installation

In order to be able to execute your own python statements it should be noted that scripts are only tested on **anaconda distribution 4.5.11** in combination with **python 3.6.6**. The scripts don't require additional python libraries.

Two quick start options are available:
- [Download the latest release.](https://github.com/windelmm/SeattleAirBnB/master/)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/windelmm/SeattleAirBnB.git`

## Motivation
For the second term of the nanodegree [become a data scientist](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) of [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/) I got involved in this project. I was particular interested in identifying some tips and tricks for people who want to rent accomodation in Seattle during the least crowded periods with a budget in mind. [Airbnb](https://airbnb.com).  

## File descriptions

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files.

```text
SeattleAirBnB/
├── seattle_airbnb.ipynb
├── calendar.csv
├──listings.csv
```

- seattle_airbnb.ipynb ==> Notebook to investigate trends of bookings on Airbnb in the year 2016-2017 in Seattle.
- calendar.csv         ==> Booking information of houses in Seattle.
- listings.csv         ==> Information of accomodation in Seattle.

## Results
We know it's cheapest and least crowded during the first few months of year but not January and part of February, so March or April would be best to book a room or appartment. Now the cheapest rooms are in Rainier Beach followed by Olympics Hills and Sout Delrigde, so I would look in these areas.
